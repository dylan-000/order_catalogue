# Order_Catalogue
CMPSC 421 lab to design, develop, and document RESTful API using Node.js and Express.js, with a focus on asynchronous programming and efficient data handling.

## Implementation
- First, I created the necessary MongoDB schemas to model the information being used in the application. I just used a customer, product, and order schema to demonstrate working knowledge of the technologies being used. Each of the models used in allow for CRUD APIs as well as some other functional APIs related to the fact that it is an order catalogue.
